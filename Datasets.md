# **Datasets**



“Bad data = bad model, no matter how fancy your algorithm is.”





A dataset is the real-world knowledge your model learns from.

It’s basically examples → answers → patterns.



Think of it like a student learning:



textbook = dataset



exam answers = predictions



If the book sucks, the student sucks.



### 

### Types of Datasets



1️⃣ Training Dataset



Majority of the data (60–80%)



Model learns patterns from this

Like practicing questions.



2️⃣ Validation Dataset



Used to tune hyperparameters



Prevent overfitting

Like checking mid-semester test results and adjusting studying.



3️⃣ Test Dataset



Final evaluation of performance

This is your board exam 🌚



### 

### Two kinds of dataset structures

✔️ Supervised Learning Dataset



Contains Input + Output (labels)

Example (Spam Detection):



Message	IsSpam

"You won 1 crore!"	Yes

"Meeting at 6 PM"	No



You teach the model by example.



✔️ Unsupervised Learning Dataset



Only Input, no labels

The model discovers structure itself.



Example (Customer segmentation):



Age	Salary

22	10k

45	60k

33	25k



The model learns clusters automatically.







### Where do datasets come from?



✔️ Kaggle

✔️ UCI ML Repo

✔️ Google Dataset Search

✔️ Government APIs

✔️ Company logs

✔️ Scraping

✔️ Synthetic Data generators

✔️ Human labeling
