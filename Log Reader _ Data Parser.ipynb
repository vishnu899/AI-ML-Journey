The `try-except KeyError` block was correctly implemented, but the specific scenario of a missing column in a CSV row (when the header exists) results in a `None` value from `csv.DictReader`, not a `KeyError`.\n","\n","Therefore, the demonstration correctly shows the `try-except` structure for `KeyError`, even if `csv.DictReader`'s default behavior bypassed the `except` block in this specific `partial_data.csv` case."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dc82fbd8"},"source":["## Simple Program Integration\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Combine all the concepts (reading, parsing, dictionaries, iteration, error handling) into a single, simple program.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"88b65ba5"},"source":["## Summary:\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","*   **Structured File I/O:** The process successfully demonstrated creating and reading both CSV and JSON files.\n","    *   A sample `data.csv` with a header and 3 data rows was created and read using the `csv` module.\n","    *   A sample `data.json` with a list of 3 dictionaries was created and read using the `json` module, loading directly into a Python list of dictionaries.\n","*   **Data Parsing:**\n","    *   CSV data from `data.csv` was effectively parsed into a list of Python dictionaries using `csv.DictReader`, with column headers serving as dictionary keys. For instance, the first record was parsed as `{'Name': 'Alice', 'Age': '30', 'City': 'New York'}`.\n","    *   JSON data was directly loaded as a Python list of dictionaries, allowing for straightforward access to elements and their key-value pairs (e.g., successfully accessing 'Alice' using `loaded_json_data[0]['name']`).\n","*   **Iteration Patterns:**\n","    *   Data stored as lists of dictionaries (from both CSV and JSON) was iterated through effectively to extract specific fields (e.g., 'Name', 'Age' from CSV data) and to display all key-value pairs within each record (from JSON data using the `.items()` method).\n","*   **Error Handling:**\n","    *   `FileNotFoundError` was successfully handled using `try-except` blocks for both non-existent CSV and JSON files.\n","    *   `json.JSONDecodeError` was correctly caught when attempting to load an intentionally malformed JSON file, providing clear error details.\n","    *   An important nuance in `csv.DictReader` behavior was observed: if a CSV row has fewer columns than the header, `csv.DictReader` assigns `None` to the corresponding dictionary keys instead of raising a `KeyError`.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   Python's built-in `csv` and `json` modules, combined with standard data structures like dictionaries, offer a powerful and flexible foundation for processing structured data with robust error handling.\n","*   The next logical step is to integrate all these individual concepts (file reading, data parsing into dictionaries, iterating over them, and applying error handling) into a single, cohesive program to demonstrate an end-to-end data processing workflow.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Creating a file name with
